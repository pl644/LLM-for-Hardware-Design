# LLM-for-Hardware-Design

This project explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating and enhancing digital hardware design workflows. It integrates terminal-based agent orchestration, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design automation, and Verilog RTL generation.

## Directory Structure

- `aiterminal/`: Scripts for coordinating LLM agents to generate and validate hardware designs via terminal interfaces.

- `hls_version/`: High-Level Synthesis implementations, including design automation scripts, reports, and benchmark results.

- `verilog_version/`: Verilog RTL modules and testbenches, including versions generated or refined using LLM tools.

## Objectives

- Automate the hardware design workflow using LLMs, from architecture descriptions to code generation.

- Compare LLM-assisted Verilog with HLS-generated and manually written designs.

- Evaluate design quality in terms of functional correctness, performance, and hardware efficiency.

## Technologies Used

- Python, PyMTL3

- Vivado HLS

- Verilog HDL

- GitHub Copilot, OpenAI API

## Background

This repository was developed as part of a Master of Engineering (M.Eng) final project focused on applying language models to hardware design automation.
